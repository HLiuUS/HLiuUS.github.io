My name is Heng Liu ([Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.url }}/uploads/Heng_Liu.pdf)). I currently live in Novi, MI, working as a CAE Engineer at Ford Motor Company. I am interested any concise, elegent and brilliant concept and technology. In particular, I have strong passion in numerical methods, solid mechanics, and data processing.

I received my Bachelor's degree from <img src="/uploads/swjtu.jpg" width="20" height="21" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle"> [Southwest Jiaotong University](http://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) in 2011, ranking top 1 among both the ['Mao yishen'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Yisheng) Honor Class and the Department of Mechanical Engineering. At SWJTU, I was particularly interested in math and mechanics. The conciseness and rigor involved in formulas and theorems, and the wisdom of great mathematicians ( [Poisson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson), [Lagrange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange), [Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler), [Bernoulli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli), etc.) really inspired me a lot.

After graduation from SWJTU, I joined <img src="/uploads/mst.jpg" width="20" height="16" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle"> [University of Missouri at Rolla](http://www.mst.edu/) as a graduate student, mainly working on the simulation of state-of-the-art additative manufacturing process (also known as ["3D printing"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing)) with my advisor, [Dr. Frank Liou](http://web.mst.edu/~liou/). We built models to study the multiphysical fields involved in laser deposition processes, and adjusted the processes with adequate feedback systems.

Upon completing my master's work, I joined Ford Motor Company as a Duribility CAE Engineer. It is really a fortune to work for Ford — the world-class group and facility, challenging projects, passionate and talented people and collaborative environment help me improve everyday. At Ford, I learn how industry differs from academia, how theoretical knowledge work in solving practical problems, and most importantly, how my future challenges should be like. My hope is to develop more efficient, robust, and capable computational tools to solve problems in broader engineering or science disciplines.
