My name is Heng Liu [Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.url }}/pic/Heng_Liu.pdf). I currently live in Novi, MI, working as a CAE Engineer at [Ford Motor Company](http://www.ford.com/). I am interested any concise, elegent and funny concept and technology. In particular, I have strong passion in numerical methods, solid mechanics, programming, and data processing.

I received my Bachelor's degree from <img src="/pic/swjtu.jpg" width="20" height="21" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle"> [Southwest Jiaotong University](http://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) in 2011, ranking top 1 among both the ['Mao yishen'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Yisheng) Honor Class and the Department of Mechanical Engineering. At SWJTU, I was particularly interested in math and mechanics: calculus, linear algebra, statistics, complex functions, mathematic modeling, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, etc. The conciseness and rigor involved in formulas and theorems, and the wisdom of great mathematicians ( [Poisson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson), [Lagrange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange), [Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler), [Bernoulli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli), etc.) really inspired me a lot.

After graduation from SWJTU, I joined <img src="/pic/mst.jpg" width="20" height="16" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle"> [University of Missouri at Rolla](http://www.mst.edu/) as a graduate student, working on the state-of-art additative manufacturing process (also known as ["3D printing"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) with my advisor, [Dr. Frank Liou](http://web.mst.edu/~liou/).
