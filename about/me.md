My name is Heng Liu. I currently live in Detroit, MI, working as a CAE Engineer at [Ford Motor Company](http://www.ford.com/). I am interested any concise, elegent and funny concept and technology. In particular, I have strong passion in numerical methods, solid mechanics, programming, and data processing.

I received my Bachelor's degree from <img src="/pic/swjtu.jpg" width="20" height="21" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle"> [Southwest Jiaotong University](http://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) in 2011, ranking top 1 among both the ['Mao yishen'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Yisheng) honor class and the department of Mechanical Engineering. At SWJTU, the courses I enjoy most are all about math and mechanics-calculus, linear algebra, statistics, complex functions, mathematic modeling, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, etc.

After graduation from SWJTU, I decided to join <img src="/pic/mst.jpg" width="20" height="16" style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle"> [University of Missouri at Rolla](http://www.mst.edu/) as a graduate student, working on the simulation of additative manufacturing (also known as ["3D printing"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing)) process under the supervision of [Dr. Frank Liou](http://web.mst.edu/~liou/).
